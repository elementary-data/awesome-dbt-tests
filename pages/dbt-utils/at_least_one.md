# At Least One Test

This page explains the `at_least_one` test from the dbt-utils package. This test is designed to ensure that a specified column in your database contains at least one non-null value. It's a fundamental check for data completeness and integrity, particularly useful in scenarios where certain data points are critical for business processes or reporting.

## How it Works

The `at_least_one` test checks a specified column to confirm that it contains at least one non-null value. This is crucial for columns that are expected to have data for every record or at least one record in a dataset or within specific groupings of data.

### Steps and Conditions:

1. **Column Selection**: Identify the column you want to test for the presence of at least one non-null value.
2. **Execution**: The test scans the specified column across all records (or within defined groupings if the `group_by_columns` parameter is used).
3. **Outcome**:
   - **Pass**: If the column contains at least one non-null value, the test passes, indicating that the minimum data presence requirement is met.
   - **Fail**: If the column does not contain any non-null values, the test fails, highlighting a potential issue with data collection or processing that needs to be addressed.

## Example Usage: Fintech Company

For a Fintech company, ensuring that transactional data is complete and accurate is essential for maintaining trust and compliance. The `at_least_one` test can be applied to various columns in the `transactions` table to ensure critical data points are present.

Consider a scenario where the `transactions` table records details of user transactions, including transaction IDs, amounts, and timestamps.

```yaml
models:
  - name: transactions
    columns:
      - name: transaction_id
        tests:
          - dbt_utils.at_least_one

      - name: amount
        tests:
          - dbt_utils.at_least_one

      - name: transaction_timestamp
        tests:
          - dbt_utils.at_least_one
```

In this example, the `at_least_one` test is used to ensure that:
- There is at least one recorded transaction ID, amount, and timestamp.
- These tests help in verifying that the transactions table is not empty and contains essential data for each transaction.
